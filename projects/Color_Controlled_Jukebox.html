            <h1>Project Details</h1>
            <p>In a Bachelor’s level course called “Sensor Programming” I was tasked with creating an interactive experience using different sensors that could connect to an Arduino. Together with a partner, I created “Color Controlled Jukebox”, a device that would use an RGB-sensor to read colored sheets of paper and play a corresponding song to each color. My focus and responsibility in the project was the physical creation of the jukebox as well as sound design. The product was created using Arduino and programmed using Processing.</p>
