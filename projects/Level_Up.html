            <h1>Project Details</h1>
            <p>In a Master’s level course called “Multimodal Interaction and Interfaces” I was tasked with creating an interactive experience using different modalities. The goal was to explore different modalities in interaction. Together with a small team, I created “Level Up”, an audiovisual experience in which the members of the group would play a song using phones as input-devices. Using the camera, microphone and screen, different phones would correspond to different instruments and a song would be played using pre-constructed sounds. The sounds would in turn generate visuals and when interacted with would create an audiovisual experience. My focus and responsibility in the group was sound design and QA. The experience was created using Kotlin, Unity, Pure Data and FL-studio.</p>
