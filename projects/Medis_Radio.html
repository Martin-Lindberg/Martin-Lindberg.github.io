            <h1>Project Details</h1>
            <p>Since the spring of 2015, I have been hosting a podcast called “Medis Radio”. It is a show where a few friends and I review video games, movies, tv-series, songs and albums as well as comic books. The show has been running continuously and has been live streamed on Stockholm lokalradio. Apart from hosting the show, I also edit and produce every episode as well as assist with marketing. The podcast is available on Spotify, Acast, Soundcloud, iTunes and wherever else podcasts are available.</p>
