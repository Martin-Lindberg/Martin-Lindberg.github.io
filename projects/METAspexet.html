            <h1>Project Details</h1>
            <p>Ever since I was a child, Iâ€™ve always loved acting. And during my seven years at KTH I got to act out on that passion through METAspexet, an interactive musical that involves hundreds of students from the Media Technology Chapter as well as the Computer Science Chapter. Every year, a new show is produced and performed for the public. Throughout my years, my responsibility and passion for the project has kept growing and the roles I have had include but are not limited to director, head of script and head of music. My biggest takeaways from it are that I now have a good competence in project management, pedagogy and that my previous fear for public speaking is now all gone. On the contrary, I love to interact with people and to make them smile or laugh and I feel a big pride in my ability.</p>
