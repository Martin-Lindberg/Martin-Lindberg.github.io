            <h1>Project Details</h1>
            <p>In a Bachelor’s level course called “Interaction Programming and the Dynamic Web” I was tasked with creating an interactive website that would use an API and use cookies. Together with a small team I created “The Hogwarts Webservice”. An interactive website where a user could read up on people and spells from the Harry Potter-universe as well as sort themselves into one of the four houses presented in the series. My focus and responsibility in the project was administration, design and QA. The product was made using JavaScript and React.</p>
