            <h1>Project Details</h1>
            <p>In a Master’s level course called “Sound in Interaction” I was tasked with creating “The soundscape of the future”. Together with a partner, I made “Covid-19 in sound”, an audial experience where a timeline of Covid-19 cases and deaths would be displayed and accompanied by a soundscape to accentuate the numbers to create a sense of dread or hope. My focus and responsibility in the project was that of programming and sound-design. The project was made using Pure Data.</p>
