            <h1>Project Details</h1>
            <p>In a Bachelor’s level course called “Reflective Design Process” I was tasked with creating a low-fi prototype of a product with a digital component. The goal was to experience the design-process of a product, going from ideation to forming a fictional company and developing, marketing and delivering a prototype of a product. Together with a small team, I founded and created “MemoAR”, an application made for AR-headsets focused on people suffering from early stages of dementia that would assist with everyday tasks. The UI of the program would subtly assist the user with directions, calendar-notes and reminders of people around them using facial recognition. Since the product was very futuristic in nature, a low-fi prototype using a smartphone was created to reflect a more realistic product of the time. My role in the project was head of PR and lead designer. After the project was over, members of the team went on to found MemoAR as an actual company via KTH Innovation. I was not a part of that transition.</p>
